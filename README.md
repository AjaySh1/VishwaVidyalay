## This was my first website which was built using HTML and CSS, and now I would be diving deeper into the world of development. The link to the project demonstration video is given below.
This was my website and the idea was also originally brought up by me and my friend  Animesh Mishra . This is a website about searching and exploring different colleges in India. Currently, it just has the IITs, NITs & IIITs from India but we are looking forward to adding more features to this.
